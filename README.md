# Annual-Sales-Report

# My First Excel Dasboard
In this project I have worked on a one year sales dataset of a store.

I have performed following operations on the data set-

-> Data Cleaning

-> Data Processing

-> Data Analysis


I haved worked with the pivot tables in this project and created a very beautifull and fully dynamic dashboard.
I have solved, analise multiple problems in this project. The problems are as follows-

-> Compare the sales and ordes using single charts.

-> Find the month of highest sales and orders.

-> Comparison of men vs women shopping.

-> Analyze the percentage of order status.

-> Top 10 states that contributes hightest in sales.

-> Relation between age and gender based on the orders.
On the basis of above data analysis I have provided solutions to increase the sale of the store.




-> Which channel contributing to the maximum sales.

-> Highest selling category.
